Crazy Passenger Problem

*100 passengers aboard an airplane with exactly 100 seats. Everyone has a ticket with an assigned seat number. So passenger 1 will have assigned seat #1. However, the first passenger has lost their ticket (becomes crazy) and takes a random seat. Every subsequent passenger attempts to choose their own seat, but takes a random seat if theirs is taken. What is the probability that the last passenger #100 will get his/her assigned seat #100?*

**Details**

- Assume 100 passengers and 100 seats in the airplane
- The purpose of the assignment is to see programming code and **NOT** a mathematical solution. So please implement an airplane seating simulation.
- Feel free to write classes, functions in any programming language you want. 
- For eg. There will be an api which will take 100 passengers and 100 seats and return true or false (based on if last passenger got his/her own seat). This simulation can then be run for thousands or millions of times and then based on the true/false counts, the probability can be calculated. If you run the simulation 100 times and 50 times you get “true” then the probability is 0.5
- Write unit tests
- Send the code in text files (with .txt extension) to *anurag.ambekar@credit-suisse.com* and *boris.rybalkin@credit-suisse.com* by the suggested time frame
- Include a readme file if required
- Just to reiterate, we are not interested in the mathematical solution. We want to arrive at the answer by running a simulation multiple times which will take 100 passengers and make them seat in the airplane. The more you the run the simulation, more accurate the answer will be.
- After a review of the assignment, we will set up a follow up Zoom call to discuss the implementation. 


**Follow-up**

- There will be a follow-up session on the assignment. So have the development environment (IDE and assignment code) ready to be shared on a Zoom call.
- Please have Zoom client installed so that you can join the call and can share your development environment.
- For eg. have the Intellij or visual studio or any other IDE ready to go on your machine. Have your code open there. Then you can share this IDE in the Zoom call. 
- Make sure your code compiles and you can run the simulation on the call.
- We would go through the code with you on the call and can ask questions on different parts of the implementation.
